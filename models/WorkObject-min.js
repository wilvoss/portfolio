The project was revitalized with the goal of bringing it to market as swiftly as possible. Despite the core gameplay being exceptional, the UX unfortunately fell short, as it was unintuitive, unhelpful, and somewhat unappealing. Specifically, users struggled to understand where to focus their attention, the meaning of certain visuals, and how to successfully play the game.

Twelve color combinations in all were added, each named after a feeling. In addition, I added an alternate pattern to help those users who found the default set less distinguishable. Support for different shape sets was added which allowed me to provide Cat Mode. Doing that pushed me to consider rebranding the entire game to "Copycats!" but I personally find the cat outlines much more difficult to play with. Finally, I recognized my own need to play in the middle of the night and not disturb my partner, so I introduced Dark Mode.
