            <p>I'm a passionate maker who is deeply committed to designing fantastic user experiences that drive
              engagement and product growth while meeting the user's needs. I've designed for clients including
              Microsoft, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, McGraw Hill, Charles Schwab, and Avanade. For a more complete

              Because my skill set includes front-end development, I have rare insight into the engineering capabilities
              and compromises that often need to be accounted for when bringing a product to market. As a tenured
              designer, I've been directly involved in many product disciplines including marketing, program management,
              development, partner relations, stakeholder presentations, and management. I bring great value to every
              project I work on due to this depth and breadth
              of skill and experience.
            </p>
            <p>During my career, I've worked with some amazing people on an array of fabulous projects. Here is a
              sampling of what some people I've worked directly with say about my skills and professionalism:</p>

              &#8220;Wil is a game changer. He's a rockstar in core UX design, bringing creativity and professionalism
              to the role. He's dynamic and flexible. Wil is always willing to jump in even if its outside his area of
              responsibility. At
              Suplari, Wil consistently collaborated well across functions and drove initiatives forward. And I also
              love the way
              he's kind of a "swiss army knife" -- so many ways he can contribute -- from UX to code to strategy to
              management &
              leadership.&#8221;

            </p>
            <p>
              &#8220;I asked Wil if he could design a search tool for my board game cafe's game library. He had a
              prototype working in just a few days and ultimately delivered a very polished app with a multitude of
              features above and beyond what I asked for. My customers have been very happy with the product since we
              launched it. It's rare to come away from a project like this with total satisfaction, but Wil delivered,
              quickly and professionally.&#8221;
